save as file
image layer that has is an embedded image
test browser support (and provide appropriate taxes)
//could be a "map" filter?
//overlap option (see wandering lines)
//brightness tolerance
"no layers exist" text
decompress thing for save repair
//color ramp
//variables and math expressions
option limit skeletons (for documentation)
better width and height customization (set limit, with warning)
proper negative offs
wandering2 direction offset
make loading more safe (test ways to break / exploit saving)
  save format is not finalized, do this way later
palette
HILARIOUS parody logos!
list of controls
fix tiling for worley (none powers of 2)
PBR material creation (???)
remove some mix types? a couple of them feel like filler
bring back direction inputs!!!
combine filter -- takes in two layers and combines them into one layer (could be useful for an emboss effect?)
blur filter
repeat filter -- copies the layer several times with an offset (motion blur type effect)
rotate filter
quantize filter
contrast filter
make a not-wandering layer
disable corners or edges
merge liney and noise layers? a lot of their options are awfully similar...
mix options for the blobs layer

URGENT

ctrl + scroll to zoom in and out

blend types for layer interpolation (e.g. border corners, vornoi noise) "mix types"
value noise layer
perlin noise layer
//img.blend function is broken! when the col1 alpha smaller than col0 thing look weird
edit tint switch layer dont switch color edit color SEE BUG
more accurate layer icons

REMINDERS

clean up unused garbage
//DONT SLAP MORE SHIT ONTO SHIT
//the set color function sucked it was like 4 times slower
//take a break! work on the programmer art thing
//snap! image editor
fix layer key bugs! there's still a bunch.....

is the "color picker style" code too voodoolicious? would it be too confusing for someone unfamiliar with those functions, even if they learned about them? is it unecessary abstraction?

floating point bitwise operators? could be interesting
