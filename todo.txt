STUPID

save as file
image layer that has is an embedded image
test browser support (and provide appropriate taxes)
//could be a "map" filter?
//overlap option (see wandering lines)
//brightness tolerance
"no layers exist" text
decompress thing for save repair
//color ramp
//variables and math expressions
option limit skeletons (for documentation)
better width and height customization (set limit, with warning)
proper negative offs
wandering2 direction offset
make loading more safe (test ways to break / exploit saving)
  save format is not finalized, do this way later
palette
HILARIOUS parody logos!
list of controls
fix tiling for liney -- it stinks with lower break levels
fix tiling for worley (none powers of 2)
PBR material creation (???)

URGENT

ctrl + scroll to zoom in and out
scroll to move up and down
shift + scroll to move left and right
blend types for layer interpolation (e.g. border corners, vornoi noise) "mix types"
a layer base of -1 should filter the entire canvas
value noise layer
perlin noise layer
//img.blend function is broken! when the col1 alpha smaller than col0 thing look weird
colp and option consistent sliders
make layer sliders render with some delay (avoid similar problems as color picker)
edit tint switch layer dont switch color edit color SEE BUG
disable corners or edges
layer managment buttons are not visible on mobile (kind of important!!!)
crop filter
scale filter
combine filter -- takes in two layers and combines them into one layer (could be useful for an emboss effect?)
or just more options for the solid layer
  change filter icons when the base is changed
draw layer control icons
more accurate layer icons
layer button insets remove those
fix tile view scaling
proper direction input... again!
fix layer key bugs! there's still a bunch.....
the code is getting stale! rewrite it soon....
merge the blend modes and mix modes? some of them are quite similar in purpose and functionality...

REMINDERS

clean up unused garbage
//DONT SLAP MORE SHIT ONTO SHIT
//the set color function sucked it was like 4 times slower
//take a break! work on the programmer art thing
//snap! image editor

is the "color picker style" code too voodoolicious? would it be too confusing for someone unfamiliar with those functions, even if they learned about them? is it unecessary abstraction?
