blend types for layer interpolation (e.g. border corners, vornoi noise) "mix types"
link layer that copies another layer's pixels and modifies them
filter layer that modifies the current cavnas' pixels
value noise layer
perlin noise layer
give the solid layer similar options to border layer
save as file
image layer that has is an embedded image
remove external dependencies
make killAllChildren() and other similar functions global in tether.js, and make tether.js just be html--js interaction functions
ctrl + scroll to zoom in and out
scroll to move up and down
shift + scroll to move left and right
frutiger aero ui -- stuff can look crappy as long as it's also interesting
save stuff in cookies (?)
"use strict" can help clean up sloppy code
better width and height customization (set limit, with warning)
god images (random names and layers)
test browser support (and provide appropriate taxes)
save authors
option limit skeletons (for documentation)
//could be a "map" filter?
color picker sometimes doesnt reprint the image when youre done changing it
//shown option changes eye button
//take a break! work on the programmer art thing
//overlap option (see wandering lines)
//brightness tolerance
//img.blend function is broken! when the col1 alpha smaller than col0 thing look weird
//the set color function sucked it was like 4 times slower
//later
//snap image editor
//layer link
//color ramp
//tiled view
//variables and math expressions
//filters (?) they seem kinda slow.....
	//layer tiling periods, layer offsets
	//scale + normalized scale (like xor fractal)
	//plot filters (only change the output of plotPixel()) dont seem like they'd be slow
//perlin noise
//DONT SLAP MORE SHIT ONTO SHIT
