URGENT

verify if the normal map stuff is even correct (create a heightmap of a coin, then sunlight it blahhhh)
crop filter
ctrl + scroll to zoom in and out
scroll to move up and down
shift + scroll to move left and right
gradient think with css variables
undo
ADD CHANGES TO CHANGE LOG!!!
proper layer icons
save as file
make loading more safe (test ways to break / exploit saving)
  save format is not finalized, do this way later
  less cryptic error messages
list of controls
ui looks like shit!
restructure code to allow for the image/layer renderer to be used on it's own (without the editor). people (kit) have told me that procedraw could be useful for html5 game textures.....
  layer wrappers
  actual documentation / tutorials
layer presets
the code is getting stale! rewrite it soon....
better width and height customization (set limit, with warning)
//variables and math expressions
MAYBE?: tether should be written in a way that one could just rewrite functions for a different ui system and everything would still work (doesnt make sense, since it's javascript)
download dialog. actually, just dialogs in general
"no color selected" thing for color picker, it's confusing otherwise
i had a dream about the normalize layer, therefore add it
//could be a "map" filter?

STUPID
replace direction input (old school boolean version) with either a fancy dial or less fancy keyvalue list
centered shear / pivot point (do this for most transform filters, actually)
offset for wavetable (curvy)
image layer that has is an embedded image
test browser support (and provide appropriate taxes)
//overlap option (see wandering lines)
"no layers exist" text
decompress thing for save repair
//color ramp
option limit skeletons (for documentation)
HILARIOUS parody logos!
fix tiling for worley (none powers of 2)
PBR material creation (???)
remove some mix types? a couple of them feel like filler
bring back direction inputs!!!
quantize filter
disable corners or edges
merge liney and noise layers? a lot of their options are awfully similar...
mix options for the blobs layer (col0 -> col1)
embed pdimg data into a png, have that png be from procedraw (static, obviously) but have that png be able to be loaded into procedraw
random tile export option (several different renders of the image put together)
merge layer should merge several layers (?)
strict input for width (FORCE it to go below 0. maybe this could be an input box function option?)

dent and crystal filters (see: paint.net)
noisy blobs // fractal blobs? mess with distance function?? clustered blobs???
description for pictures
blobs/worley sample SOMETHING from a layer
rounded corners for border

unsafe number and length inputs stay red when the slider is changed
good emboss
rotate filter
rgb normal for contrast layer
lacunarity for noise layers? 
easeMode for wandering
option for wandering lines to stay proportional (like errrrr when rotated they stay the same euclidean length)
blend types for layer interpolation (e.g. border corners, vornoi noise) "mix types"
perlin noise layer
//img.blend function is broken! when the col1 alpha smaller than col0 thing look weird
edit tint switch layer dont switch color edit color SEE BUG
more accurate layer icons
proper direction input... again!
merge the blend modes and mix modes? some of them are quite similar in purpose and functionality...
make controls more visible on mobile (see: firefox device simulation mode)
ehhhhh astroids preset is broken for worley noise
consistent ease modes and ease modes for more layers
look into what the unit length stuff is actually doing... some results seem funky when printed out
merge layer bugs, specifically with the dissolve, halftone, and bayer modes

REMINDERS

go through TODO comments

clean up unused garbage
//DONT SLAP MORE SHIT ONTO SHIT
//the set color function sucked it was like 4 times slower
//take a break! work on the programmer art thing
//snap! image editor

is the "color picker style" code too voodoolicious? would it be too confusing for someone unfamiliar with those functions, even if they learned about them? is it unecessary abstraction?

floating point bitwise operators? could be interesting

"invalid" colors (brighter than 1 and darker than 0) can be very useful

normal maps are a huge, gigantic can of worms. adding too many features related to them MAY make procedraw incomprehensible

consider how colorblind people might view the layer icons

software is not improved by adding and adding to it. it is improved by addressing the problems with said software.
remember what terry says.

VOLATILE 0.9 changes:
bitmapText
string type
rewrote shit lel


VOLATILE 0.8 changes:
* layers:
  * added emboss filter
  * added sharpen filter
  * added HSV filter
  * added blur filter
  * added contrast filter
  * more options for the blobs layer
  * more options for the worley layer
  * more layer icons
  * overblown test, bayer, and halftone blend modes
* ui:
  * unit length input for most layers (position/dimensions can be in pixels or % relative to the image dimensions)
  * rotation input
  * new layer selection input
  * fixed some bugs from the ui design
  * fixed t.renderOnUpdate not doing anything
  * added t.smoothCanvas
* debug:
  * the 'l' key prints img.layers
  * the 'd' key prints the image data and anything wrong with it
