save as file
image layer that has is an embedded image
test browser support (and provide appropriate taxes)
//could be a "map" filter?
//overlap option (see wandering lines)
"no layers exist" text
decompress thing for save repair
//color ramp
//variables and math expressions
option limit skeletons (for documentation)
make loading more safe (test ways to break / exploit saving)
  save format is not finalized, do this way later
  less cryptic error messages
palette
HILARIOUS parody logos!
list of controls
fix tiling for worley (none powers of 2)
PBR material creation (???)
remove some mix types? a couple of them feel like filler
bring back direction inputs!!!
quantize filter
disable corners or edges
merge liney and noise layers? a lot of their options are awfully similar...
mix options for the blobs layer (col0 -> col1)
embed pdimg data into a png, have that png be from procedraw (static, obviously) but have that png be able to be loaded into procedraw
random tile export option (several different renders of the image put together)
merge layer should merge several layers (?)
strict input for width (FORCE it to go below 0. maybe this could be an input box function option?)

dent and crystal filters (see: paint.net)
enums should probably maybe be moved to their own file. makes stuff less cluttered
noisy blobs // fractal blobs? mess with distance function?? clustered blobs???
description for pictures

URGENT
push updates sooon...... there are a lot

proper layer icons


unsafe number and length inputs stay red when the slider is changed
good emboss
rgb normal for contrast layer
lacunarity for noise layers? 
easeMode for wandering
option for wandering lines to stay proportional (like errrrr when rotated they stay the same euclidean length)
crop filter
ctrl + scroll to zoom in and out
scroll to move up and down
shift + scroll to move left and right
blend types for layer interpolation (e.g. border corners, vornoi noise) "mix types"
perlin noise layer
//img.blend function is broken! when the col1 alpha smaller than col0 thing look weird
edit tint switch layer dont switch color edit color SEE BUG
more accurate layer icons
proper direction input... again!
the code is getting stale! rewrite it soon....
merge the blend modes and mix modes? some of them are quite similar in purpose and functionality...
make controls more visible on mobile (see: firefox device simulation mode)
actual documentation / tutorials
better width and height customization (set limit, with warning)
rotate filter
ehhhhh astroids preset is broken for worley noise
layer presets
restructure code to allow for the image/layer renderer to be used on it's own (without the editor). people (kit) have told me that procedraw could be useful for html5 game textures.....
  layer wrappers

REMINDERS

clean up unused garbage
//DONT SLAP MORE SHIT ONTO SHIT
//the set color function sucked it was like 4 times slower
//take a break! work on the programmer art thing
//snap! image editor

is the "color picker style" code too voodoolicious? would it be too confusing for someone unfamiliar with those functions, even if they learned about them? is it unecessary abstraction?

floating point bitwise operators? could be interesting

"invalid" colors (brighter than 1 and darker than 0) can be very useful

normal maps are a huge, gigantic can of worms. adding too many features related to them MAY make procedraw incomprehensible

consider how colorblind people might view the layer icons



VOLATILE 0.8 changes:
* layers:
  * added emboss filter
  * added sharpen filter
  * added HSV filter
  * added blur filter
  * added contrast filter
  * more options for the blobs layer
  * more options for the worley layer
  * more layer icons
  * overblown test, bayer, and halftone blend modes
* ui:
  * unit length input for most layers (position/dimensions can be in pixels or % relative to the image dimensions)
  * rotation input
  * new layer selection input
  * fixed some bugs from the ui design
  * fixed t.renderOnUpdate not doing anything
  * added t.smoothCanvas
* debug:
  * the 'l' key prints img.layers

  look into what the unit length stuff is actually doing... some results seem funky when printed out
